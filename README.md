[Welcome to Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
A step in the direction of security, privacy, and performance.

This site introduces Manifest V3 for Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3). It presents the background and reasons for introducing Manifest V3 and our vision for the platform's future, along with guidance on how to optimize your extensions to use Manifest V3.

Manifest V3 represents one of the biggest shifts in the extensions platform since it launched a decade ago. Extensions using Manifest V3 will enjoy enhancements in security, privacy, and performance; they can also use more contemporary Open Web technologies adopted in Manifest V3, such as service workers and promises. Developers can update their extensions today to take advantage of these Manifest V3 features; this will become mandatory as we phase out Manifest V2 in the future.

Manifest V3 is part of a shift in the philosophy behind how we approach end-user security and privacy. The pages in this section provide an overview of Manifest V3, the reasons behind it, and how to approach it:
